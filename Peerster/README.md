# CS-438 - Peerster Homework 3

This is the reference implementation for CS438 Peerster system, homework 3.

## Peerster vs Hippocrates:
This folder contains code related to Peerster. Peerster is a peer to peer system I developed during the semester for the CS-438 course as part of graded homeworks. The main logic used in Hippocrates (like Gossip Protocol) is taken from Peerster code. Once again, please do not consider this code as a faithful representation of my coding skills, since some revision is still needed. Finally, note that the Rumor Mongering logic has been adapted from the work of a colleague of mine.
